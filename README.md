# [ supershape exporter ]

[ supershape exporter ] is a custom software to export supershapes in OBJ format, and it is based on the supershape by Paul Bourke. The main formula was first proposed by Johan Gielis around 2000, suggesting that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature.

It is based by "Coding Challenge #26: 3D Supershapes" by Daniel Shiffman
